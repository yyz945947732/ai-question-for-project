I want to develop a library called "ai-question-for-project", and its main functionality is "Generate AI-oriented questions about creating project code based on the project's file information.".
It's a CLI script.
The project does not use TypeScript.
The project already uses the following dependencies (but feel free to add more):
directory-tree,fs-extra,read-pkg,update-notifier,yargs-parser.
Could you help me write the core code in the context of English?
Here is the directory structure of the project:
└── ai-question-for-project
    ├── bin
    │   └── index.js
    ├── biome.json
    ├── knip.json
    ├── lib
    │   ├── index.js
    │   ├── mainCode.js
    │   ├── package.js
    │   ├── run.js
    │   └── tmpl.js
    └── package.json
